This project is structured such that multiple frontend and backend apps can co-exist. Frontend apps are stored in the `<repo-root>/front` subdirectory, each containing its own `package.json`. Backend apps follow a similar convention and are stored in `<repo-root>/back/`. The root of the repo also contains its own `package.json` which contains mostly utilities.
